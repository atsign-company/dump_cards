## Security token

These scripts need a security token with access to read:org 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/478926/133479440-04abd22f-d3c3-4082-90ad-1431898839ce.png)

The token should be in an environment variable `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`

An easy way to do this is first have a file ~/.api_keys.sh containing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# API keys for GitHub etc.
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN='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' # <- put your token here
# ^ this token was deleted already so it needs to be replaced
```

and then source the script into your shell:

```bash
. ~/.api_keys.sh
```

## Interactive script

First install [InquirerPy](https://pypi.org/project/inquirerpy/):

```
pip3 install InquirerPy
```

Then run:

```
./interactive.py
```

The menus will then prompt for selection of org, project type, and column
before exporting the column to .csv

a single file that can be imported to Planning Poker.  
`./merge.sh`
